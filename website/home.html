    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>All around the world soccer is the most popular sport. It deserves some reconition in America more than is being shown. Over 3 million people attended the world cup and millions more watched from their t.v. Soccer in Europe is a huge deal and many fans will travel miles and miles just to watch their team play. The reason behind this obsession is passion. That is one thing that soccer in America lacks.  </p>
    <p>In Europe soccer is all they have whereas in America there is so many chances to do whaterver you want to do not just play a sport for your career. Therfore, if the best soccer players in the world grew up in America instead of their home country in Europe or South America, I feel like they wouldn't have become what they are today. Maybe Messi would have been a Lawyer or a engineer. Who knows?   .</p>
