    <h3>AC Millan Spends $250 mil for 7th Place?</h3>
   <img  class="llnews" src="https://goo.gl/GQRCbi">
   <p>AC Millan is a club know for its amazing history. Having won Serie A 17 times and the UEFA champions league 7 times they were once the most feared club in europe. Having the likes of legends like Maldini, Ronaldihnio, Kaka, Shevchenko, and Van Basten they were unstopable. So what happended? How did a dynasty become a team that can't finish top 5 in the league? the answer is money. As players get more and more money they lose the passion for playing soccer. The legends in the past didn't need money to play their hearts out on the field. The Managenment team at AC Millan think that money is the anser to their recent stuggles, but it is really the lack of passion that is losing them games. Spending $250 mil on players isn't gonna win you games, passion is.</p>
